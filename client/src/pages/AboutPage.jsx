        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a burgeoning full stack web developer currently
          expanding my horizons through UCLA's edX Full Stack Development Boot Camp. Based in
          the vibrant city of Los Angeles, CA, I'm deeply immersed in the world of coding, constantly
          exploring the vast potential of upcoming technologies and their capacity
          to contribute positively to society. My journey into the realm of technology started with 
          a simple curiosity about how computers work and what they can achieve. This curiosity 
          quickly evolved into a passion, leading me to where I am today â€“ on the cusp of 
          completing an intensive program at UCLA designed to arm me with the skills needed to build 
          comprehensive, user-friendly, and efficient web applications from scratch.
          When I'm not elbows-deep in code, I express myself through music. I'm a drummer for bands 
          such as Meishi Smile and Pacific Palace, where I find a different kind of rhythm and 
          collaboration that parallels the teamwork and creativity I bring to web development projects.
        </p>
        <h4>My Mission</h4>
        <p>I believe in the power of collaboration to bring innovative ideas to life. Whether
          it's developing the next groundbreaking application or creating digital solutions that
          make a difference, I'm here to turn visions into reality. With a blend of technical
          knowledge, creative problem-solving, and a keen eye for design, I'm ready to tackle
          challenges and contribute to projects that aim for impact and excellence. If you're 
          looking for a dedicated and creative full stack developer with a unique
          perspective, let's get in touch. Together, we can deploy applications that not only
          meet user needs but also exceed expectations, making a mark on the digital landscape.</p>
