# Zachary Roy's Personal Portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio!

After graduating the full stack development course at UCLA edX, I thought I should make a website showcasing my progress, and all of the many things I have worked on! With this, I can keep updating my site with new projects whenever necessary. I have used everything I learned to make a sleek and seamless site, that is also mobile friendly as well.
